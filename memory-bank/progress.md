# Progress

## What Works
- Basic project setup with Maven.
- Initial file structure.
- Memory bank initialization.
- HTTP header security implementation:
  - API key authentication
  - x-api-key header validation
- Item controller with validation
- Exception handling for validation errors
- Documentation of security approach

## What's Left
- Add unit and integration tests for API key validation
- Create examples for clients on how to use the x-api-key header
- Implement additional authentication mechanisms for sensitive operations
- Implement additional controller endpoints for item management

## Current Status
- HTTP header security implementation updated to use API key authentication
- Whitelist approach implemented for better security and educational value

## Known Issues
- Clients need to be updated to include the x-api-key header
- API key is currently stored in plain text in application.properties
- Need to implement a more secure way to manage API keys in production
