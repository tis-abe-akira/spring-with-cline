# Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementing HTTP header security measures using an API key authentication approach.

## Recent Changes
- Changed header validation from content hash to API key authentication
- Implemented API key validation using x-api-key header
- Added API key configuration in application.properties
- Updated documentation to reflect the new approach
- Added SpringDoc OpenAPI for API documentation generation
- Integrated Spring Boot DevTools for enhanced development experience

## Next Steps
- Add unit tests for the API key validation
- Create examples for clients on how to use the x-api-key header
- Consider implementing additional authentication mechanisms for sensitive operations
- Configure and customize OpenAPI documentation

## Active Decisions
- Using an API key authentication approach:
  1. API key configuration in application.properties
  2. Validation against x-api-key header value
- Focusing on simplicity and educational value for the sample application

## Considerations
- Balance between security and usability
- Providing clear error messages for missing or invalid API keys
- Documentation for API consumers on how to use the API key authentication
