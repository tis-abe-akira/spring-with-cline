# Active Context

## Current Focus
Enhancing HTTP header security measures using Spring MVC's standard authentication patterns.

## Recent Changes
- Migrated from servlet filter to Spring MVC's HandlerInterceptor for API key validation
- Implemented centralized error handling using ControllerAdvice
- Reorganized security components:
  - Moved authentication logic to security/interceptor/ApiKeyInterceptor
  - Moved header escaping to security/interceptor/HeaderEscapeInterceptor
  - Moved validation logic to validation/HeaderValidator
- Updated error status codes to align with Spring Security patterns (401 for authentication failures)
- Added uniform error response format using ErrorResponse class
- Removed legacy filter-based implementation
- Updated test scripts to reflect new status code expectations

## Next Steps
- Add unit tests for the API key validation using MockMvc
- Add integration tests for the complete authentication flow
- Create examples for clients on how to use the x-api-key header
- Consider implementing additional authentication mechanisms for sensitive operations
- Configure and customize OpenAPI documentation
- Consider implementing rate limiting for API endpoints

## Active Decisions
- Using Spring MVC's standard features for security:
  1. Ordered HandlerInterceptors for request processing
     - HeaderEscapeInterceptor (order: 1) - all requests
     - ApiKeyInterceptor (order: 2) - API endpoints only
  2. ControllerAdvice for centralized error handling
  3. Consistent 401 status codes for authentication failures
- Clear separation of concerns:
  - Security (interceptors for authentication and sanitization)
  - Validation (dedicated validation package)
  - Error handling (centralized through ControllerAdvice)
- Maintaining uniform error response format across the application
- Focusing on Spring best practices and maintainability

## Considerations
- Balance between security and usability
- Consistent error handling across all endpoints
- Clear error messages for authentication failures
- Documentation for API consumers
- Future integration with Spring Security
