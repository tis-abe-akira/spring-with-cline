# Project Brief

## Overview
This document outlines the core requirements and goals for the validation project. It serves as the source of truth for the project scope.

## Goals
- Implement robust input validation to ensure data integrity and security.
- Provide clear and user-friendly error messages.
- Design a flexible and maintainable validation system.
- Integrate validation seamlessly into the application workflow.

## Scope
- Validate user inputs for all relevant data fields.
- Handle various validation scenarios, including data type, format, range, and custom rules.
- Implement both client-side and server-side validation.

## Out of Scope
- Specific UI design and implementation (focus is on validation logic).
- Database schema design (validation should work with existing schema).

## Success Criteria
- All defined validation rules are implemented and enforced.
- The application handles invalid inputs gracefully and provides helpful feedback to the user.
- The validation system is well-documented and easy to maintain.
