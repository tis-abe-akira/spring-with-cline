# Product Context

## Purpose
This project aims to enhance the reliability and security of the application by implementing comprehensive input validation. It addresses the need to ensure data integrity and prevent potential vulnerabilities arising from invalid user inputs.

## Problem
Without proper validation, the application is susceptible to:
- Data corruption
- Security breaches (e.g., injection attacks)
- Unexpected behavior and crashes
- Inconsistent data

## Solution
The validation project will provide a robust and flexible mechanism to:
- Validate user inputs against predefined rules.
- Provide clear and informative error messages to guide users.
- Prevent invalid data from entering the system.
- Improve the overall user experience by ensuring data consistency.

## User Experience Goals
- Users should receive clear and understandable error messages when they enter invalid data.
- The validation process should be seamless and not disrupt the user's workflow.
- Users should feel confident that the application handles their data securely and reliably.
